operating_systems_3453
======================

Two programs from the Operating Systems Concepts class at UC Denver


os_cp_1
-------

Simple shell interface that makes system calls, emulates the actual shell.

cd
ls
pwd
cat
mv

These commands and more.


os_cp_2
-------

CPU scheduling algorithm simulator. 
Reads a file which depicts process IDs, arrival times, and burst durations. 

The processes are fed through the simulator and a tabular output of data is printed
to standard output.

------------------------------------------------

This is also an exercise in over engineering with the use of factory and strategy 
patterns for a simple, one-off school assignment.

*Note - gcc sucks when using outdated versions!*
